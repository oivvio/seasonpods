  - title                                 : Limited series and audio drama only
    description                           : <strong>Season</strong> only lists long form podcasts that tell one story over many episodes. It can be limited series like <strong><em>Serial</em></strong> and <strong><em>S-Town</em></strong>, or audio dramas like <strong><em>Homecoming</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Black Tapes</em></strong>. No news, sports, pundits or "three dudes with a microphone"-style shows.

    description                           : Since <strong>Season</strong> is tailored to serialized shows it's a lot simpler than your average podcast player. There are no feeds or subscriptions to juggle. Just start playing a season and it plays all episodes from beginning to end. It's as simple as an audio book player.
